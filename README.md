**A browser agent with a dynamic, indexed action space.**

Give it one goal. [TypeSafe's Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction) picks an operation and an element. A small LLM writes text only when the operation is `TYPE_TEXT`.

**Zürich → London on Google Flights in 7.1 seconds.** One natural-language goal, actual text generation, and loading waits included.

## The action space

Every observation produces a new element table:

```text
[1] button    Change ticket type · Round trip
[2] combobox  Where from?        · San Francisco
[3] combobox  Where to?          · empty
[4] textbox   Departure          · empty
...
```

The operations are `CLICK`, `TYPE_TEXT`, `PRESS_ENTER`, `SELECT`, `SCROLL_UP`, `SCROLL_DOWN`, `WAIT`, `DONE`, and `BLOCKED`. Only supported operations and targets are offered: a control covered by a dialog or banner is not offered, and large dropdowns are capped.

```text
                      one TypeSafe request
                     ┌───────────────────────────┐
page → element table → operation                 │
                     │ click_target              │
                     │ type_text_target          │
                     │ select_target, if present │
                     └─────────────┬─────────────┘
                         use the matching target
                                   │
                    CLICK [7] ─────┤──→ browser
                TYPE_TEXT [3] ─────┘
                          ↓
                   small LLM → text → browser
```

Target questions are speculative. If the operation is `CLICK`, only `click_target` can execute. Two decisions, **one network round trip**. Each target head contains only compatible elements. Native dropdown choices carry an observed element/option index.

There are no site-specific action scripts or prepared field strings in the policy. The Flights example supplies a goal and independently verifies the outcome. The screenshot renderer adds labels afterward; it does not drive the browser.

## Try it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/jev-ultrafast.git
cd jev-ultrafast
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
# Add TYPESAFE_API_KEY and TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY, or one OPENROUTER_API_KEY for Jev and both helpers.
uv run jev
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8766**. It is a test console: pick a verified task (core, wildlife, or real-life suite) or a custom URL, toggle System 2, and click **Start run** (it runs to the end; **Pause** stops it), or **Run this suite**. It shows numbered elements, operation and target probabilities, whether Jev asked for System 2 and what System 2 decided, a gates table (values against thresholds), run cost, and an independent verification of the final page. After a pause, **Choose next** and **Execute choice** step manually and **Run automatically** resumes. **Speak goal** dictates the goal in Chrome/Edge (Web Speech API, which sends audio to the browser's speech service).

Chrome connects through [Browser Harness](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-harness), installed by `uv sync`. Run `uv run browser-harness --doctor` if it needs connecting. Allow remote debugging in Chrome when prompted.

`TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY` is an OpenRouter key in the example configuration. The current demo uses `inception/mercury-2.5` with reasoning disabled. Gemini, GLM, and DeepSeek can also use the OpenAI-compatible text helper; configure the appropriate model, endpoint, and reasoning setting.

## Use the library

```python
from jev_ultrafast import Agent

with Agent(
    "https://www.google.com/travel/flights?hl=en",
    "Find one-way flights from Zurich to London on September 20, 2026, "
    "for one adult in economy. Stop when matching flight options are visible.",
) as agent:
    for state in agent.run():
        print(state["elapsed_ms"], state["status"])
```

Run with `uv run --env-file .env python your_script.py`. The same policy can run a different task:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python examples/run.py \
  --url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page \
  --goal 'Find and open the Wikipedia article about Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.'
```

`uv run --env-file .env python examples/flights.py --keep-open` performs the flight search, checks the actual route/date/results, and saves its trace. It does not select or book a flight.

## System 2: slow review, same action space

Jev is System 1: fast, one request per step. `Agent(..., reasoning=True)` or `examples/run.py --reasoning` adds a reasoning LLM as System 2. Jev decides when to use it: the same Jev request carries one more yes/no head, "should System 2 decide this step?". System 2 sees the same element table and chooses from the same operation/target heads. Code validates its answer like any Jev answer, and it still never emits selectors or text to type. Its one-sentence note goes back to System 1 and the text helper as context. See [design.md](docs/design.md#system-2-review) and [reasoner.py](jev_ultrafast/reasoner.py).

```text
                one Jev request
page → operation + targets + system2? ── no ──────────────────────→ execute
                                  │                                   ↑
                                  └─ yes → reasoning LLM (System 2) ──┘
                                           validated operation + target
```

Whichever system chose it, the executor never runs the same action with the same argument more than three times.

`uv run python scripts/compare_systems.py --suite all` runs the core, [wildlife, and real-life suites](docs/benchmark.md) and checks each final page independently; `--max-calls` caps a session's model calls. In [a small smoke comparison](docs/system2.md), Jev asked for System 2 only at hard steps. The final round passed 10/10 with review and 9/10 without, at the same median time.

## Why it moves

- **One request per decision cycle.** Operation and target heads share the same observed state.
- **No screenshots in the default agent loop.** Jev consumes structured state. The inspector opts into screenshots; the video uses a separate continuous screencast.
- **One browser call per snapshot.** Read visible controls, their names, values, and text atomically. Keep references to the actual DOM nodes.
- **Validate the selected target.** Clicks check the document, form values, target, and nearby context. Animation alone does not force another prediction. Resolve current geometry and reject covered controls before input.
- **Wait for useful state.** After typing into a combobox, wait for visible suggestions, capped at 200 ms. Other interactions get at most two animation frames or 50 ms. These reads happen after execution is logged.
- **Keep hidden tabs rendering.** Focus emulation prevents background animation throttling without switching Chrome's visible tab.
- **Send visible text.** Offscreen article bodies and footers do not fill the model context.
- **Reuse an interrupted text request.** A generated value survives a stale-page retry only if the entire text-helper input is unchanged.

Every executed target is resolved from an observed node. The executor rechecks page freshness and click occlusion. Model output never becomes selectors, coordinates, shell commands, or executable JavaScript. Text-helper output must parse as a small JSON object before typing.

## Evidence and limits

The current video is a **7,073 ms** Google Flights run. Timing starts after initial page observation and includes model calls, generated text, browser work, stale decisions, and loading waits. A fresh independent check verifies the one-way setting, Zürich, London, September 20, 2026, and visible flight options. The video plays at 1×, with no opening hold and a 0.5-second final hold.

In six alternating runs with identical models and settings, both versions passed **3/3**. Median task time went from **9.450 s → 7.092 s**, a **25% reduction**; median browser protocol calls went from **1,092 → 101**. This is three repeats of one task on one browser profile, not a general reliability benchmark.

The same policy opened the requested Wikipedia article in **2.798 s** and passed a local hotel search/filter task in **1.896 s**. Runs, failures, source hashes, and measurement boundaries are in [performance.md](docs/performance.md).

A `DONE` choice still requires independent outcome verification. The DOM reader handles common HTML and ARIA controls, not the full accessible-name specification. Shadow roots, frames, canvas, uploads, pop-up tabs, nested scrolling, and arbitrary keyboard widgets remain outside this MVP. Owned tabs share the existing Chrome profile.

## Development

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
node --check jev_ultrafast/static/app.js
node --check jev_ultrafast/snapshot.js
uv build
```

Tests are offline. `uv run python scripts/check_guards.py` checks real controls in a local browser without model calls. Live examples and recording scripts make paid API calls. `scripts/record_flights.py <new-folder>` captures original browser timestamps; `scripts/render_demo.py <recording-folder>` renders that verified run at 1× and crops out the Google account strip. Credentials and raw traces stay ignored.
